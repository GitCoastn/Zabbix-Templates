# Template: Canon MF Printers by SNMP
## Sources
For my research the following sources were helpful:
  - Initial template from https://github.com/zabbix/community-templates/tree/main/Printers/Canon/template_canon_color_mf_printer-working (which had too many invalid objects and was too static in my opinion)
  - Multiple threads to understand the OID-structure
  - https://oidref.com/
## Testing
I own a Canon i-sensys MF752Cdw, which i used a lot to test all kind of items and discoveries. Feel free to report any issues.
> [!NOTE]
> Actually I wasn't able to test the tray load-trigger, as my printer has no sensors to measure the level. I'd be happy to receive feedback here.
